# Rakuten Viki TV Shows and Movie Analysis

This repository shares my Jupyter Notebook that I used to analyze two **[datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/victorsoeiro/rakuten-tv-dramas-and-movies)** on the popular online video streaming service **[Rakuten Viki](https://www.viki.com/)**. The purpose of the analysis was to gather trends and insights on its most popular television shows and movies, as well as the actors/actress who feature in them. The American website features Asian TV shows and movies from Korea, China, Taiwan, Japan and Thailand translated in over 200 languages. The datasets include 1,800+ titles and 19,000+ credits for actors/actresses and directors.
